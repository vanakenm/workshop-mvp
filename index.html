      # From an idea to a MVP

      ![MVP](images/mvp.png)

      # Who and Why

      ---

      ## You

      ---

      ## Me

      * Martin Van Aken - [joyouscoding.com](http://www.joyouscoding.com)
      * Software Developer since 15 years
      * Co-founder of [PullReview](http://pullreview.com)
      * Coach at [LeWagon](http://www.lewagon.org)
      * CTO at [Bluesquare](http://www.bluesquarehub.com)

      ---

      > I've been developing software for the last 15 years.

      > I'm from the other side. I'm here to help.

      ---

      ## Why

      * Moved my activity from big companies to startups
      * Met a lot of business owners those last 4 years
      * This is a summary/faqs from those discussions

      ---
      
      ## Why

      * Software is expensive
      * Business require to change/adapt

      ---

      ## Agenda

      1. What is an MVP
      1. Before the software
      1. Technology brief
      1. Developers
      1. Getting software done

      ---

      # What is an MVP

      ---

      ## Definition

      * **Minimal**: not a dream, not even a v1
      * **Viable**: able to attract/interest users
      * **Product**: providing value (entertainment/productivity/whatever)

      ---

      ## What it's not

      * A fully defined product
      * A technical test

      ---

      ### It has to be used by real users to be useful

      ---

      ## Why

      ---

      ### Validating your business (**audience, problem, solution**) as soon as possible

      ---

      ### Assumption: you cannot know everything from the start

      ---

      ### Assumption: you are willing to evolve

      ---

      # Before the Software

      ---

      ## In the beginning

      * An audience...
      * ... with a problem...
      * ... that is valuable to solve...
      * ... and possible to solve

      ---

      ### Let's take that in order

      ---

      ## Identify the audience

      ![audience](images/audience.jpg)

      ---

      ### Some bad examples

      * "This is for everyone"
      * "We have three types of customers"

      The closest thing I know to an "app for everyone" is Facebook. You are not Facebook (and even they started with a quite specific audience)

      ---

      ### Some good cases

      * Pick an audience you know
      * Be careful that **you are not your audience** even if you are **in** your audience

      ---

      ### Being specific is good

      * Easier to find ("watering hole")
      * More consistent in their problems
      * You can't reach "everyone" anyway

      ---

      ### Best bet

      The **knowledge of your audience** is the biggest thing you bring as a business founder (much more important than your idea).

      ---

      ## Interlude: About 'ideas'

      * We talk a lot about ideas
      * How to protect them
      * How valuable their are

      ---

      ### The reality

      ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-B1s7XCUAE_nYd.jpg)

      ---

      ### They are not so valuable

      * They are only about the solution
      * They will probably change
      * Execution matter much more

      ---

      ### You should talk more than protect them

      * Get feedback
      * You are not your idea
      * You have much more than your idea

      ---

      ### What is -your- audience ?

      ---

      ## Identify the problem

      ![problem](images/problem.jpg)

      ---

      ### What we are looking for

      * It may not be the one you think
      * There may be a bigger one
      * Needs to be there AND worth solving

      ---

      ### Problem interviews

      * 15-30 minutes interviews
      * In person or call (avoid surveys)
      * 12-15 interviews

      ---

      ### Example Script

      * Welcome
      * Demographics / Ice breaker
      * Story
      * Problem Ranking
      * Today's situation
      * Thanks and ask

      See a more complete version [here](http://startitup.co/guides/285/problem-interview-script)

      ---

      ### Efficiency

      * 15 times 30 minutes = just **7.5 hours**
      * After 6-8, people start repeating themselves.
      * That's **very cheap** to validate your business

      ---

      ### Added benefits

      * Start connecting to your audience
      * Create a possible alpha user list

      **No reason not to do them.**

      ---

      ### Fail fast

      >  I understand you don't want to hear your idea is bad (or that you are not solving any problem). But let's be honest - if it is actually bad, better to know it as early as possible

      ---

      ### What problem are -you- attempting to solve?

      ---

      ## Identify a solution

      ![solution](images/solution.jpg)

      ---

      ### Ask the prospect to dream

      * Let's imagine that this is working
      * Would it solve your problem?
      * Would you pay for it?

      ---

      ### Mockups

      ![mockups](images/mockups.jpg)

      ---

      ### Mockups

      * Create a story board on paper
      * **Play it** before your prospect
      * Updating mockup is incredibly **cheap**
      * Those will be useful for later anyway


      ---

      ## Audience, Problem, Solution

      ---

      ### Pitch as a summary

      ![pitch](images/pitch.jpg)

      ---

      ### Example 1

       My company, **LeWagon**<br>
       is developping **a 9 week coding bootcamp**<br>
       to help **entrepreneurs**<br>
       to **get their first MVP out**<br>
       by **developing it themselves with our coaches help**

      ---

      ### Example 2

      My company, **Bluesquare**<br>
      is developping **Web Application**<br>
      to help **ministries of health in low income countries**<br>
      to **encourage good behaviour from health centers**<br>
      by **giving them money based on the value they provide to the population**

      ---

      ### Let's try!

      ---

      # Technology brief

      ---

      ### What language/technology should I use for my project?

      > 99% of the project does not have any specific technology requirement - ie, on the tech side, your project has nothing peculiar

      > (That's good BTW).

      ---

      ### Two rules

      - One that is known by your developer
      - One that is popular

      That's all.

      ---

      # Developers

      ---

      ## Technical Cofounders

      > I'm starting a band. I can't really play any instrument or sing, so I'm looking for a few musical co-founders.

      > [Ryan Greenberg](https://twitter.com/greenberg/status/204294460421586947)

      ---

      ### Startup

      A startup is a company whose main product is a software.

      ---

      ### Are you looking for a Cofounder? (1)

      If you are not ready to let shares go, you’re not looking for a Cofounder - you are looking for a developer but you don’t want to pay.

      ---

      ### What about 50%?

      I'll be building the software, what are you bringing? (hint: there are a lot of good answers to that question, but "the idea" is not one of them).

      As a starting company, your stock is worth basically nothing - in a sector which is rewarding well, this is a difficult situation.

      ---

      ### Are you looking for a Cofounder? (2)

      If you have defined everything business-wise, you’re not looking for a Cofounder - you are looking for a developer but you don’t want to pay.

      ---

      ### You are not going to find one

      Only 25% of founders are technical. Most of those have ideas themselves they want to make happen.

      ---

      ### Summary (1)

      > You are competing with other people with ideas - work your pitch. Show your unfair advantage. Think about what would make someone invest her sweat and skills at your company and not someone's else.

      ---

      ### Summary (2)

      > You can't bet your business on finding a technical cofounder in a specific amount of time

      ---

      ## Freelances

      ---

      ### Pros

      * Used to deliver
      * Experimented
      * Can stop/encore when you want
      * Can switch for other skills

      ---

      ### Cons

      * Hopping between projects
      * Expensive (day rate ~ 500€)
      * Quickly to 5-10K

      ---

      ## Employees

      ---

      ### Pros

      * Dedicated
      * Depends on experience level

      ---

      ### Cons

      * Single set of skills
      * Not easy to let go/start again
      * Expensive (total)
      * Single bullet

      ---

      ## General recommandations

      Freelances are the safest bet (best value for money to get started) - but they get expensive really fast, which means you need to optimize their time.

      # Getting Software Done

      ---

      ## The Grim Situation

      ---

      ### The Disaster Recipe

      * Software is expensive
      * Business changes
      * Business owners are bad at requirements
      * Developers are bad at estimations
      * Business owners and developers are not speaking the same language

      ---

      ### Some statistics

      Software costing 15M+ are typically:

      * 7% late
      * 45% overbudget
      * 44% done

      [McKinsey Study](http://blogs.gartner.com/mark_mcdonald/2012/10/29/mckinsey-report-highlights-failure-of-large-projects-why-it-is-better-to-be-small-particularly-in-it/)

      ---

      ![](images/half-house.jpg)

      ---

      ### Size matters

      The more complex the software, the biggest problems we get in requirements and estimations.

      This is not linear - it's exponential.

      ---

      ### Fixed price

      * Looks like a good idea
      * Almost impossible for all but the simplest (= shortest) projects
      * Risky: Who decide if/when it is "done"?
      * Require very detailed specification
      * Risky (2): Who can say it's per the specification or not?

      ---

      ### Collaboration vs Contracts

      > Remember that every minute spent arguing over who is right is a minute lost for your project. Be sure it's worth it.

      ---

      ## What works

      * Keep the project small
      * Split them into smaller tasks
      * Discuss on working software more than requirements
      * Every task should have a user-observable result
      * Rinse & repeat

      ---

      ## User Stories

      ---

      ### Definition

      * A way to describe a single functionality of your software
      * One sentence

      ---

      ### Template

      As a **user category** I want **given functionality** so I can get **benefit**

      ---

      ### Why

      * Simple
      * Put the user first
      * Observable
      * Force to think about the benefit

      ---

      ### Example (AirBnB)

      > As a **tourist** I want **see a list of flat available in the city I'm going to with their rate & location** so I can **see the one best for my own tastes & price range**

      ---

      ### Example (Accounting Software)

      > As a **company owner or freelance** I want **see a list of my unpaid invoices** so I can  **get them paid quicker**

      ---

      ## Mockups (again)

      ---

      ### What

      * Show how the application should look like
      * Show the interactions (clicking here leads there)
      * It should not be pretty (big boxes are good)

      [Great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrV2SZuRPv0)

      ---

      ### Why

      * Helps a lot understanding the stories
      * Give design guidelines
      * Much better specification than a long explanation

      ---

      ### Inspiration

      * Look at existing sites
      * Doing things the same way as others helps everyone
      * Keep it simple

      ---

      ### Mobile

      * More mobile than desktop traffic today
      * When doing mockups, think about small screens!
      * "Mobile first" is actually good: force to limit what you see on a single screen

      > Choices are difficult, but they lead to better designs

      ---

      ## Short iterations

      ---

      ### Setup

      * Create a list of stories
      * Prioritize them

      ---

      ### Progress

      * Developer take each story one after the other
      * Question are asked when needed (requires collaboration)
      * Software is deployed regularly

      ---

      ### Demo

      * Demo every X days (not after X stories) - X < 10
      * Discuss of the stories done, give feedback
      * Rinse and repeat

      ---

      ### Pros

      * Feedback loop is short
      * You see (and test!) your software evolving week after week
      * Easier to steer the course
      * Any misunderstanding will be catched quickly

      ---

      ### Cons

      * You need to work to create those "small stories"
      * You don't have a clear date when the software will be "done"...

      ... but you would not have it anyway

      ---

      ## Some bad signs

      * Your developer is talking in technical terms (setting up a database, validating something, etc)
      * You are not seeing a working version of your software on a regular basis

      > Real horror story: an entrepreneur in Brussels paid more than 30K to have an app delivered, and had still nothing in his hands 6 months after having started...

      ---

      ## We're talking about an MVP

      * Doing this will require you to split/axe your initial idea to something much humbler
      * Think of it as a first step
      * Put users on it, collect their feedback
      * Rinse & Repeat

      > Better to lose 2-5K than 50K

      ---

      ## Tooling

      * [Trello](trello.com) for User Stories follow up
      * Pen & Paper for mockups
